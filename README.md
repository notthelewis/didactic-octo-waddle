# didactic-octo-waddle
This project aims to count lines of working source code (i.e. excluding multi-line comments, single-line comments and blank lines) in any code using C-like syntax.

It's written in JS for the Node environment, and has absolutely zero third party dependencies other than its runtime. 

To get started, you have to run node ./main.js <path-to-file>. 

Going to add support to read multiple files soon. This is the first draft.... Or the first, second draft. The first one worked but was messy. This one aims to be cleaner.
